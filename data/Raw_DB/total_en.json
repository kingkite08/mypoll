I was killed by a rebel soldier, while taking a bullet for a patient. But when I finally woke up, I had become a child?!? And in front of me stood a destroyed carriage and a group of oddly dressed people, who were unconscious! “It’s just like a Murim world.” As I hurry to perform first aid in an attempt to save even one person, I realize that this world is that of [The Supreme Demon King], a Wuxia novel I’ve enjoyed reading. After meeting the rescue team of the ‘Three Great Doctors’, I found out that one of the person I saved was the protagonist of this novel, the future Demon King ‘Yeo Haryun’! “Hey, since I’m indebted to you for saving me, call me ‘hyung’.” For saving his life, I become sworn brothers with the future Demon King, and the White Dragon Godly Doctor, one of the most knowledgeable people around, recognized my potential and took me in as his disciple. This is the story of how I became the greatest physician in Gangho!",

The story of \"The Soul Guardians\" revolves around four 'exorcists': Father Park, who protects everyone by emitting aura with his deep faith; Hyunam, a young man who has acquired high-level martial arts after meeting a qi master; Junho, a boy who is proficient in talismans and spells with his innate spiritual abilities; and Seunghee, a tomboyish young lady who amplifies the power of the three as the incarnation of the King of Love. Using well-known horror stories, legends, and myths as material, it combines various religions and philosophies such as Taoism, Christianity, mystery religions, and shamanism to depict the stories and adventures of the four people chasing supernatural and mysterious events.",

The emperor insists on not visiting the empress dowager. The mother and the son seemed to have a bad relationship, so I reconciled them…. “If Your Majesty is being mean, tell me secretly. Then I’ll help you somehow.” Even the empress dowager, who had regained her son’s love. “I have never been attached to anyone. But I kept my eyes on you.” Why does this handsome emperor suddenly look at me with his twinkling eyes…. I really want to run away. If I had a baby with this man, everyone would be happy except me.

But then, this guy asks me a really strange question. \"...Do you, perhaps, have another man?\" You're hitting on the female lead, and now you're asking me this? Just bear with it. This guy will regret it later. I'll just stay as your devoted fiancée until then! \"What are you talking about?

        "description": "Laniakea, the royal princess scorned for her weak elemental power. She always dreamed of escaping the contempt directed at her. One day, a marriage proposal arrived from the Empire. The suitor? Hyperion, the First Imperial Prince, with no political base or support to his name. Laniakea willingly accepted the proposal. She didn’t care who her husband would be, as long as she could leave her homeland. Before the wedding, Laniakea saw the marriage contract presented to her. [ The couple shall engage in interc**rse __ time(s) every __ for the purpose of producing an heir. ]Fortunately, that clause remained incomplete, and the marriage proceeded as it was. As expected, her husband only dined with her a few times a year and didn’t even stay in the Imperial Palace, returning to the borderlands instead. For three years, this continued. She thought she could quietly live out her days until another prince ascended to the throne, at which point she could leave the palace for good… “The Second, Third, and Fourth Princes have all passed away!” While everyone was reeling in shock, Hyperion returned to the Imperial Palace, swiftly brought order to the chaos, and ascended to the throne. What the newly crowned Emperor needed now was a strong Empress to solidify imperial authority. ‘So, he’ll divorce me and remarry someone from a powerful family.’ That’s what she assumed… “You summoned me…?” “Yes. Because there’s something I must ask of you.” With a resolute expression as if he’d made up his mind, Hyperion spoke seriously, causing Laniakea to swallow nervously. ‘The moment has finally come.’ “I know what you want. Don’t worry. I’m willing to comply with Your Majesty’s wishes.” “…Is that so?” She had no doubt that they were both thinking the same thing. “Let’s sign the divorce agreement right away.” “Let’s have a child right away—son or daughter, it doesn’t matter.” It was then that Laniakea realized. Her husband had something entirely different in mind.",

        "description": "I was reincarnated into a wretched harem story with no dreams or hopes, when the heroine died for some reason. The shock of the original story being destroyed disappeared after a while. My older sisters then started to get involved with the male leads. The playful and obsessive emperor found my eldest sister, who was mature and affectionate. The blunt and strongest swordsman in the Empire matched with my cheerful second sister. Meanwhile, my cynical youngest sister was paired with the playboy Head of the Magic Tower. And me? I’m only six years old, so I’m not allowed to have a love interest. Anyway, my sisters got along well with the male leads and held their weddings. But… “Liliana. Call me ‘Oppa’.” My youngest brother-in-law tried to win me over with splendid illusion magic and asked me. “Am I your favorite brother?” My second brother-in-law, the swordmaster, carried me on his shoulders and coaxed in a whisper. “Liliana. As my youngest sister-in-law, you will live in the Imperial Palace and be treated like a princess.” My eldest sister nodded nonchalantly upon hearing the Emperor’s declaration. But I only want to go back to the time when I lived with my sisters and there were just the four of us? #Childcare #Affection #ThisAbility #TinyFemaleLead #ChildhoodFriendMaleLead #TheCoolestSistersInTheWorld #ThreeBrothersInLaw #BrotherInLaw1(Emperor) #BrotherInLaw2(SwordMaster) #BrotherInLaw3(GeniusMagicTowerMaster)",

Until one day, the family was hanged for treason. ‘There’s no need to kill me, who ran away from home 7 years ago and is only doing research in the countryside!’ The moment I realized that the academy, who said that I was a genius and would treat like a family, betrayed me, and that treason was also falsely accused by someone… Due to a mysterious power, I returned to a year ago! “I can’t help it. Now that it’s like this, I, who is smart and strong, has no choice but to save the family.” There were two things to do for the family. “Will I be of help to you someday too?” “I tried to save him because he is precious to my grandfather.” Restoring the relationship with the family, which was a mess, and… “Please pretend to be in a relationship with me externally.” Holding hands with ‘that man’. Oh, before that. Pouring a water bottle over the dean’s head during the lecture, I said, “This is gravity.” Get revenge on those academy guys who have no morals.

It wasn’t until I was killed by the Blood Demon, whom I had called “teacher,” that I learned the truth. When I awoke again as a thirteen-year-old child, I decided to return to the Namgoong family. I didn’t seek to be recognized as family. I only wanted to prevent the Namgoong family from falling apart as it had before. “This is the jewelry, silk, gold bars, and elixirs that the family head has gifted to you.” “Here, little one. This is a congratulatory gift for your return.” As soon as I was recognized as the lost granddaughter of the Namgoong family, I gained delicious food, fine clothes, gold and silver treasures, and a high-quality sword! I also gained a grandfather and a father who cried and laughed for me. But what was that strange, tingling feeling in my chest every time that happened? In order to protect the smiles of those I had once killed, and to preserve this warm and ticklish sensation for as long as I could, I was determined to change the bloody future that awaited me, unlike my previous life… Namgoong Mucheon’s face darkened. ‘Is this child truly raised to be an assassin?’ The sharp killing intent and the sword techniques essential for an assassin were reflected in her life, as if they were embedded in her very being. ‘Damn brat.’ Anger surged within Namgoong Mucheon. He restrained himself from cursing aloud in front of his granddaughter, muttering in his mind instead. ‘How dare they raise my granddaughter as an assassin?’ The blue energy surrounding Namgoong Mucheon grew even stronger.

        "description": "Kang Da-hye is a long-term baeksu living an ordinary life. On the day she fails to get another full-time job, she regresses back to 11 years ago. “I’m a high school student again!” “I have to take the SATs again and go to college!” “I’m really going to do well in this life.” She passed the SAT. She got into Hankuk University and got a job in the last semester. She earns money and buys stocks and coins in advance. She lives hard with that mindset, but boys keep bothering her. “Kang Dahye. I hate you the second most in our class.” Jung Eun-sung was there when I regressed. The main vocalist of a male idol group that debuted a year later. “Dahye, have you seen where Jisoo is?” Seo Jae-gyeom, her crush during that time. The illegitimate son of a chaebol where her mom worked as a helper. They’re both very handsome, What the hell! Her life is more important to her now than because her life will definitely be ruined in 11 years. But… “You know how much I like you.” “Can’t you just un-like me? I’ve done nothing wrong…” As usual, life doesn’t work out the way you think. ‘Guys, I have to study…’ #Regression #School #RomCom #Growth #FirstLove #MutualSalvation",

[No matter how hard you tried, did the situation refuse to improve? Oh dear, could that really have been your fault?] But the truth was different. “Yeoreum, right now, you look really pathetic….” [Due to an error, your points have been transferred to someone else for 10 years.] All my frustrations and failures—it was because of you, Do Gyeoul. The reason I couldn’t reach my cherished goal of becoming an actress was because of you. I realized it the moment I died, when a status window appeared before my eyes. And then, immediately after, as if it were a lie— “…What is this?” [♣From an unknown, nameless actress to a national star!♣ Let’s make your name known far and wide. Reborn as an actor who will go down in history.] I returned to when I was twenty years old. A time when I could change everything. ‘I mustn’t be overshadowed by Do Gyeoul’s connections this time.’ “Hello, I’m Han Yeoreum, here for today’s model audition.” So I went to find someone who would become the greatest photographer in Korea’s future, “Then, I’ll start my acting now.” And I auditioned for the lead role in the drama destined to make waves. I took back everything she had stolen from me, one by one. And when I did— -At the pre-edit screening, Jegal Rok… I heard he’s planning to attend. The biggest figures in the entertainment industry began to focus on me. “But, Yeoreum.” My peer and, before my regression, a triple-million-hit actor. Myeong Je-ha smiled faintly with his handsome face. “It’s strange… This is your first play, but you act like you’ve memorized all the lines….” Ding—! [Name: Myeong Je-ha] Level: An eternally breathing star At that moment, I realized. “I’ll listen to the lie you’ve prepared next time.” The man in front of me was also a regressor. #EntertainmentIndustry #CapableFemaleLead #ActressFemaleLead #GrowingFemaleLead #RefreshingFemaleLead",

As far as Suin knows, that man embodied every single one of those traits—an obsessive, pe*verted psycho. And now, that lunatic is back. “Finally, we meet.” “Adult Lee Suin.” He didn’t even try to hide the sticky hunger in his gaze, like a starved lion finally spotting its prey. “A job reassignment?” “I want Lee Suin to help me.” Chairman Woo Ilhwa, unaware of his son’s true intentions, reassigns Suin, his chief secretary, to serve as his son’s personal secretary. This forces Suin into close proximity with the man who’s been preying on her from the shadows. “Wait for me, Lee Suin.” During his eleven years of exile, Jaehee had dreamed of one thing: A proper relationship—not as a restricted minor, but as a full-grown adult. A relationship where he could take what he wanted, whenever and however he pleased. That’s why, even though Suin was as rigid as a steel rod, his sly persistence ignited the spark within him whenever he faced her. “What do you want from me?” “You.” “Lee Suin.” But it seems Suin has been flirting with some bastard behind his back, and Jaehee’s jealousy and obsession explode. “Don’t take a single step.” “Unless you want to see me go completely insane.” What nonsense. You were already insane to begin with.  Illustrator: BADegg",

Whenever that is. So, I'll wait.” The pure-hearted boy Cheon Yeon-soo from H Village answered at the end of his teens. Unable to mortgage the rest of her life in a place other than Seoul, Kang-hee escaped H Village on the first day of her twenties, longing for her body's moisture to be the 'Arisu' filled with salt, not the groundwater of H Village. 12 years after leaving H Village, the car woman stained with fine dust and exhaust gas occasionally misses the servant of H Village. Yeon-soo's world was divided into two on the last day of his nineteenth year. A world with Kang-hee and a world without her. He wanted to build a picture-like house on that blue meadow and live a lifetime with our beloved 'Kang-hee'. 12 years since Kang-hee left for Seoul, giving him an empty can at the bus terminal. Even while treating a calf, even while putting down a foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, he occasionally misses Kang-hee. #Cover Illustration: Kim Dan-woo",

You'll end up only looking at me.” Her white skin was clear even up close. He slowly raised his hand to touch her cheek. Her soft skin slipped through his fingers like a baby's. Her black pupils were even more moist and dark up close. If his words came true and she ended up only looking at him with those eyes. “I really can't stand it.” I can't help it if you can't be mine, Jin Yeseo. You can't avoid it, so you have to adapt.

        "description": "I possessed the sickly older brother of the main character in the 19+ BL novel 《Grey》. The problem is that the villain, who torments the main character and obsesses over the protagonist, disappears without a trace. In such cases, the best is the cliché of amnesia, which can occur without context and without asking any questions. “I only remember my name. Baek Jin-gyeom.” But the reactions are strange. It's not going as I expected? “Do you really want to find your memory?” Baek Jin-woo, who seems to be revealing that he is not looking for his memory. “Are you not interested in me now?” The main character, Tak Won-beom, who should have been disgusted rather than interested. “I thought of you even when I went home yesterday.” The sub-main character, Seon Su-hyuk, who keeps approaching. ……Is this possession okay?",

        "description": "Shin Sung-ha, a pitcher struggling in the minor leagues, becomes entangled with Woo Seung-gun, a major league star pitcher he idolized. However, rather than being excited or happy about this dream-like relationship, he worries. \"I want you to stay at the top, senior.\" \"...\" \"So we can't date. I hope you just play baseball, senior.\" Baseball over romance. He didn't want Woo Seung-gun, who was showing the pinnacle of baseball, to become unstable because of him. But Woo Seung-gun was tenacious. \"Did you not like sleeping with me?\" \"...Pardon?\" \"We weren't bad. You were clinging to me like crazy...\" \"No, what are you talking about!\" He tries to start a relationship with him after many twists and turns, but a terrible incident befalls the two. Despite repeated regressions, he can't prevent Woo Seung-gun's death. Finally, after three regressions, Sung-ha goes back three years. To save Woo Seung-gun, he tries to erase their relationship and aims to leap as a batter, not a failed pitcher.

After realizing his own death, Yejoon expects to go to the afterlife, but then he hears from a suddenly appearing system that if he succeeds in debuting in a novel, he will be revived. Moreover, he is given the opportunity to debut in another popular group by turning back time to 5 years ago. He decides to possess a character in a novel he read a few years ago. Thus, Yejoon enters the novel and struggles alone to achieve his goal, but it's not easy. He thought he would naturally enter the body of the protagonist 'Jung Ji-on', but he possessed the body of a villain with the same name as him. However, he can't go back to the gates of the afterlife, so he tries hard to do his best, but he is assigned to the lowest class 'Class 4' in the personal evaluation, and due to the ridiculous ability of the 'villain Ji Yejoon', Yejoon unintentionally makes mistakes in every competition. Will Yejoon be able to succeed in joining the debut group and return to the time he wants.",

This is a romantic comedy(?) about Geon-ah Jang, who mistakenly possessed an omega in a ridiculous omega-verse drama, trying various attempts to escape. *** “Why are you so off today? It's not like you, mother.” ‘Eek.’ I almost screamed on the spot. Mother, mother! It was an unbelievable word coming from the mouth of a man who is taller than me. “It's not something for you to worry about, Haejung.” “Haejung?” Haejung's low voice was filled with confusion. I shut my mouth, thinking, ‘Oops, did I get the title wrong?’ Haejung was still staring at me with his arms crossed.

It was a rough, deep voice that crawled along the damp floor. The man was so tall that Yebon had to crane his neck painfully just to meet his gaze. “You shouldn’t say you’ll slap someone so carelessly.” Yebon cautiously opened his tightly closed mouth to ask. “…Why?” The man, who cast a sidelong glance at Yebon, who was full of caution, placed his hand on his shoulder and leaned in close. The scent of heavy musk mixed with a sharp fragrance seemed to envelop Yebon’s neck. “It would be a waste to just let this go.” Expectantly.",

His misery was too intense for him to recall that tiny detail of help. As he returned to school after a three-year break, as if he had fled from terrible things about dominant Alphas, he met an Alpha in the library. Tall, with a pleasant pheromone that spread as though possessed. He continued to approach Yeonwoo. “Don’t you go to school?” “I took a leave of absence. What about you, Yeonwoo?” “Me too. I will attend next year.” “Which school?” “University W.” His face was tinged with amazement.

He has been in love with the youngest son of the prestigious Hyun family, Hyun Tae-oh, for a long time. Knowing well that his feelings could never be reciprocated, he devoted himself to theology and is now on the verge of becoming a full-fledged priest. One night, a drinking party is held to welcome Archbishop Hyun Tae-oh, who has returned to the capital from a conflict zone after 7 years. Going to pick up his drunk younger brother, Hyun-jin accidentally ruins his clothes and ends up waiting for them to be washed in a restaurant's side room, unable to wear anything but a loincloth. And next to him is the naked Hyun Tae-oh, who has collapsed due to excessive drinking. The next morning, Hyun Tae-oh wakes up and misunderstands what happened the night before. Hyun-jin, who has secretly liked him since childhood, impulsively jokes that Hyun Tae-oh attacked him in his drunken state. But before he can explain that it was a joke, Hyun Tae-oh insists on taking responsibility for making a priest impure, and the situation spirals out of control as Hyun Tae-oh, the fiancé of the Princess of Je Yang-guk, suddenly breaks off his long-standing engagement with the royal family... What will be the outcome of the innocent one-night stand between Je Yang-guk's top cold-hearted strategist Hyun Tae-oh and Je Yang-guk's most naive and pure-hearted Yoo Hyun-jin?",

        "description": "When I was young, I met Lee Jungin at the orphanage. We had the same name and birthday. The only difference was that he was the sole omega of a chaebol family. But after a car accident, I woke up in his body. “Take this body. It’s yours, Choi Jungin.” The moment Jungin saw this sentence on the very first line of a notebook he happened to find, his breath caught in his throat. We had joked about it before. Lee Jungin envied my freedom since I had no family, while I envied him for being wealthy and having siblings. But how…? How could this happen? He’s not a magician or a wizard; how can you just swap bodies at will? “It’s dangerous, child.” “Jungin, you need to be careful.” “Hey kid, let me take you to your room. Wrap your arms around my neck.” I’d heard that the alpha family considered Lee Jungin, born an omega, to be a disgrace, but his brothers’ behavior seemed a little strange. And that wasn’t the only odd thing. “Which bastard did this to you?” “Uh…” “I asked you, who messed with you, Lee Jungin?” Lee Jungin even had a fiancé—an extremely dominant alpha who treated him surprisingly well. “Jungin, tell me. Were all the things you said to me lies?” “Hey… Beomhyeon.” – Yeah? “Want to play a game?” With a self-deprecating smile, Jungin pressed the back of his hand against his hot eyes and asked: “Even if I were ugly, poor, without a family… Even if I were a beta… would you still like me?” – Yeah, I would have.” With trembling lips, Jungin closed his eyes as Beomhyeon’s steady voice, full of certainty, continued: – Don’t worry, Jungin. No matter what you look like or where you are, I’ll find you and love you more than anyone else in this world. The conversation with Beomhyeon gradually eased his anxious heart. – I love you, Jungin. I’ll take all your fears away, so you just keep smiling and be happy. Listening to the gentle voice whispering like a dream in his ear, Jungin fell into a deep sleep. For a very long time, until a new dawn, his phone remained turned off.

However, when Yugeon realizes that Ian is using him for his image, he threatens to tell their school friends, and Ian comes out with a counterattack... “I don't care if you tell them. But whatever the result, it's not my responsibility.” He intended to just give an apology and end it... Just watch! I'll do as you wish!!
